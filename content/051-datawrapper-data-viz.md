Initially intended to reporters as a tool for data journalism,  Datawrapper fills a niche with its ability to enrich stories with interactive charts, maps and tables that are interactive, responsive, and embeddable on any website. 

Datawrapper's free tier is very generous with various live-updating charts, easy to embed and responsive. The [professional solution](https://www.datawrapper.de/pricing) is expensive but allows removing the Datawrapper attribution and create print-ready graphics in SVG and PDF version. The company is based in [Berlin](https://bit.ly/39l9zUe).

Below are the auto-updating graphs generated using Datawrapper. The data for the graph are served directly from [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rvibek/covid19_nepal/main/data/covid19aggregate.csv), which gets updated daily.
