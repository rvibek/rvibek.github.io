Summary: Changed my site again. I had been using [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank") for a long, guess it time for change. I am now switched to [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org" target="_blank"). 

Quickie!

I have changed my site again. I had been using [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank") for a long, guess it time for change. I am now switched to [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org" target="_blank").  Although I was using light-weight theme in Wordpress and running [CloudFlare](http://www.cloudflare.com" target="_blank") for CDN goodness, site was very slow sometime. 

I had tried Ghost in their hosted site a couple of months back and then the trial period ended. The design and simplicity of Ghost was impressive. 

During the weekend, I installed Ghost in [Openshift](http://www.openshift.com" target="_blank"). A few click click with [Ghost plugin for Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghost/" target="_blank") - BAM my site is running on Ghost. It feels fast, clean and simple. 

I am using awesome [Ghostium theme](http://ghostium.oswaldoacauan.com/" target="_blank"). I still need tweak and add search and realted post functionality.
