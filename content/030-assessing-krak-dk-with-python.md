Summary: Now the V2 extracts phone and location of the person being search. The scripts gets the results blazingly fast. I can avoid loading krak.dk in the browser to search for the people’s phone number !

I added bit of extra lines on the previous version of my [Krak](http://www.krak.dk" target="_blank") scraper. Now the V2 extracts phone and location of the person being search. The scripts gets the results blazingly fast. I can avoid loading krak.dk in the browser to search for the people’s phone number ! :) (http://i1.wp.com/www.rvibek.com.np/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?w=605)
