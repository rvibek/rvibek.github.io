It has already been 6 years since I started using Ubuntu. I started with Ubuntu 5.04 (Hoary Hedgehog) – I think that was the second Ubuntu release.

Update 2012 – running 11.04 in [Lenovo S205](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/s-series/s205/" target="_blank) ( crappy machine when it comes to Linux) and 12.04 in my desktop. [12.10](http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.10/ "Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal)") Quantal Quetzal is out now, will try it soon.
