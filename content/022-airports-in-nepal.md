Summary: After a brief hiatus, I am back again. I had download airport dataset from [ICIMOD

After a brief hiatus, I am back again.

I had download airport dataset from [ICIMOD](ftp://geoportal.icimod.org/DataSets/Nepal1_500000/Airport.zip)few weeks ago. This afternoon I felt like fiddling with it. It didn’t take too long to for me to get disappointed with the downloaded data. First and foremost the placemarks were not properly geocoded and it had a very cluttered dbf. 

Anyway it inspired me to create the following map. I got the coordinates from different sources (however, most of them were from wikipedia), I used ICIMOD’s DBF file to get the value for the runway type. And finally linked each features to their respective page in [AviationSafetyNetwork](http://http//aviation-safety.net). Happy Flying!!
